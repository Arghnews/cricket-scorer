Change dumb network lookout stuff on sender from python to bash,
as if we have the wifi connection then the network MUST be up. - done

Sender more lookout packets on start - done

Wrap everything in try except blocks, especially all the I2C stuff to make exception safe - done

Add proper logging so can debug from afar - done

Rejig net/utility especially, no need for stuff now we've binned the esp8266 entirely

Change callbacks to generators (simpler) (coroutines) as no esp8266 so it's supported and improves interface

Fix hard coding of spreadsheet path

Implement the GUI

Add filepath selection - this can, and does, block the rest of the GUI, and that's fine

Add excel cell selection to GUI for total, wickets, overs, 1st innnigs
Add workbook name
Add error cell selection

Think of neater way to parse arguments for excel reader, probably in cricket.py if excel then parse additional
    Work out how for argparse to only parse some arguments then stop, hand off to subparser

Fix argument passing in, especially log root etc.

Fix GUI:
    Saving doesn't work etc. atm
    Timeouts, split time between GUI, network, excel reader on one thread

Linting, stuff like call(a = 3) all change to call(a=3) etc.

Remove micropython/esp8266 specific stuff like random number generation/socket specific stuff as we're only on raspberry pis now

Notify when not connected or haven't received timeout in a while

	First of all, mandatory log folder, set in GUI, need logs
	Status updates
		- Connected or not, have received reply in reasonable time or not
		- Maybe something about if have path to receiver, as a proxy for if
		  connected?

Test the new select stuff with ubuntu and raspberry pis
Handle windows specific errors, and any linux/pi specific stuff too

Accept button on disconnect notify

Fix receive timeouts for receiver now we poll it in a loop

Fix gui logging it's a disgrace

singleton - using stackoverflow suggestion, check if something is using the
SENDER_LISTEN_PORT 2521, so can notify if program already running

GUI notify changed settings and need to reload

GUI logging window to read logfile live (tail -f type)

GUI rearrange to make it actually nice

Nice profile printout for GUI?

Fix double logger shit
	- Fix main gui loop first

Bug if add key to profile settings dictionary it crashes once on startup
	- Super rare, only I would add keys but could happen, fix

Implement the logger filter + colouring if want
Figure out logging

Wrap things like excel running/networking in try catch

Convert everything to import logging module and use global loggers
Look into module name before loggers

- Defintely do - shit out (as per https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-objects)
loads more logging information on errors

Fix loop timeouts for polled stuff?

Test receivers on linux

NEED -
	Revamp go that GUI starts and args and other stuff starts after
	So can always see state/errors on GUI and change config
	ie. current one is wifi is disabled, socket can't bind locally
	can't change config either
