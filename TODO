Light up all digits on startup - done

Try and fix when a digit gets stuck on - done
    1st innings first digit currently

Change dumb network lookout stuff on sender from python to bash,
as if we have the wifi connection then the network MUST be up. - done

Sender more lookout packets on start - done

Wrap everything in try except blocks, especially all the I2C stuff to make exception safe - done

Add proper logging so can debug from afar - done

Rejig net/utility especially, no need for stuff now we've binned the esp8266 entirely

Change callbacks to generators (simpler) (coroutines) as no esp8266 so it's supported and improves interface

Fix hard coding of spreadsheet path

Implement the GUI

Add filepath selection - this can, and does, block the rest of the GUI, and that's fine

Add excel cell selection to GUI for total, wickets, overs, 1st innnigs
Add workbook name
Add error cell selection

Think of neater way to parse arguments for excel reader, probably in cricket.py if excel then parse additional
    Work out how for argparse to only parse some arguments then stop, hand off to subparser

Fix argument passing in, especially log root etc.

Fix GUI:
    Saving doesn't work etc. atm
    Timeouts, split time between GUI, network, excel reader on one thread

Linting, stuff like call(a = 3) all change to call(a=3) etc.

Remove micropython/esp8266 specific stuff like random number generation/socket specific stuff as we're only on raspberry pis now

Notify when not connected or haven't received timeout in a while

    First of all, mandatory log folder, set in GUI, need logs
    Status updates
        - Connected or not, have received reply in reasonable time or not
        - Maybe something about if have path to receiver, as a proxy for if
          connected?

Test the new select stuff with ubuntu and raspberry pis
Handle windows specific errors, and any linux/pi specific stuff too

Accept button on disconnect notify

Fix receive timeouts for receiver now we poll it in a loop

Fix gui logging it's a disgrace

singleton - using stackoverflow suggestion, check if something is using the
SENDER_LISTEN_PORT 2521, so can notify if program already running

GUI notify changed settings and need to reload

GUI logging window to read logfile live (tail -f type)

GUI rearrange to make it actually nice

Nice profile printout for GUI?

✓ - Fix double logger shit
    - Fix main gui loop first

Bug if add key to profile settings dictionary it crashes once on startup
    - Super rare, only I would add keys but could happen, fix

Implement the logger filter + colouring if want
Figure out logging

Wrap things like excel running/networking in try catch

Convert everything to import logging module and use global loggers
Look into module name before loggers

- Defintely do - shit out (as per https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-objects)
loads more logging information on errors

Fix loop timeouts for polled stuff?

Test receivers on linux

NEED -
    Revamp go that GUI starts and args and other stuff starts after
    So can always see state/errors on GUI and change config
    ie. current one is wifi is disabled, socket can't bind locally
    can't change config either

✓ - Repeated bongs/notifications when disconnected, until a box is clicked saying OK

✓ - Logger init messiness

✓ - Something sometimes hangs on quit, not sure what yet
    - This is the thread handle that a plyer notification holds
    It doesn't prevent all the application stuff on my end from closing, and will look to the 
    user like it's closed so just leave it as is

✓ - Fix autoscrolling - see github
✓ - logging logs folder from GUI + errors check

Improve printouts of things like packet for debug and not
GUI printouts

✓ - WIFI notifications?
    Trouble is need zeroconfig srevice
    - This is all dumb, just put a reminder to connect to the receiver's ad hoc wifi network
    and if you're connected to that network over wifi the pi must be running
    So current is_connected notification is fine

Logger only starts once run, so if crashed before that we wouldn't get a logfile
    - Not fixing (for now)

Compile python 3.7+ on the raspberry pis

Put this somewhere -
# rm -r -fo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue src\cricket_scorer_arghnews.egg-info\; rm -r -fo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue build ; python .\setup.py sdist; echo "End of sdist"; python .\setup.py bdist
